# Evaluation

Vector Graph RAG is evaluated on three standard multi-hop QA benchmarks used in the HippoRAG papers.

## Datasets

| Dataset | Description | Hop Count | Source |
|---------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| **MuSiQue** | Multi-hop questions requiring 2–4 reasoning steps | 2–4 hops | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00573) |
| **HotpotQA** | Wikipedia-based multi-hop QA | 2 hops | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09600) |
| **2WikiMultiHopQA** | Cross-document reasoning over Wikipedia | 2 hops | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01060) |

**Recall@5** measures how much of the ground-truth supporting evidence appears in the top five retrieved results, independently of answer generation.

## Historical Results

The original three-dataset results are shown below. The [latest two-stage Jev evaluation](#jev-reranker-evaluation) builds on these results with higher recall on MuSiQue and 2Wiki and corrected relation-to-passage ordering. HippoRAG 2 resampled HotpotQA, so that historical column and the three-dataset averages use different question samples.

### Recall@5 vs. Naive RAG

![Recall@5: Naive RAG vs Vector Graph RAG](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/221a0c8d-a414-4234-ac8b-ba4223aaa2cc)

| Method | MuSiQue | HotpotQA | 2WikiMultiHopQA | Average |
|--------|---------|----------|-----------------|---------|
| Naive RAG | 55.6% | 90.8% | 73.7% | 73.4% |
| **Vector Graph RAG** | **73.0%** | **96.3%** | **94.1%** | **87.8%** |
| Improvement | +31.4% | +6.1% | +27.7% | +19.6% |

Vector Graph RAG improves over Naive RAG by **19.6% in relative average Recall@5**, with the largest gains on MuSiQue and 2WikiMultiHopQA.

The historical evaluation reached **87.8% average Recall@5**, leading on 2Wiki while trailing HippoRAG 2 on MuSiQue. **Two-stage Jev now improves both: 76.78% on MuSiQue and 95.35% on 2Wiki**, ahead of the compared baselines on each dataset. See the [Jev results below](#jev-reranker-evaluation) for the full comparison.

## Methodology

We reuse HippoRAG’s pre-extracted triplets to keep the graph input consistent across these experiments. Retrieval and reranking configurations are described in the corresponding results.

### Evaluation Setup

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    T["HippoRAG's\npre-extracted\ntriplets"] --> I["Index into\nMilvus"]
    I --> Q["Run benchmark\nqueries"]
    Q --> R["Check if gold\npassages in top-5"]
    R --> M["Compute\nRecall@5"]
```

1. **Triplets**: Use HippoRAG's pre-extracted `(subject, predicate, object)` triplets from each benchmark dataset
2. **Indexing**: Build the vector knowledge graph in Milvus using these triplets
3. **Querying**: Run all benchmark questions through the query pipeline
4. **Scoring**: Check whether the ground-truth supporting passages appear in the top-5 retrieved results

## Jev Reranker Evaluation

### Reaching the quality–latency Pareto frontier

**Two-stage Jev achieves the highest Recall@5 among the compared methods on both datasets**, averaging **86.07%** across **MuSiQue and 2Wiki, 1,000 questions each**. Under the reference latency estimates, it reaches the quality–latency Pareto frontier with **3.13 seconds of additional model-call time**.

The pipeline first selects relations, then reranks their source passages together with direct vector-search candidates. The second stage judges full passages, so the final ordering can use evidence beyond the relation text. It is a separate recipe and dataset scope from the historical three-dataset average above.

| Method | MuSiQue | 2Wiki | Average |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Naive RAG · BGE-large-en-v1.5 | 58.03 | 72.73 | 65.38 |
| Naive RAG · ColBERTv2 | 49.20 | 68.20 | 58.70 |
| Naive RAG · NV-Embed-v2 | 69.70 | 76.50 | 73.10 |
| HippoRAG · ColBERTv2 | 51.90 | 89.10 | 70.50 |
| IRCoT + HippoRAG | 57.60 | 93.90 | 75.75 |
| HippoRAG 2 | 74.70 | 90.40 | 82.55 |
| Vector Graph RAG + GPT-4o-mini | 64.41 | 91.35 | 77.88 |
| Vector Graph RAG + GPT-5-mini | 73.32 | 93.80 | 83.56 |
| Vector Graph RAG + Jev · relations only | 69.30 | 90.78 | 80.04 |
| **Vector Graph RAG + Jev · two-stage** | **76.78** | **95.35** | **86.07** |

![Quality and additional model latency](assets/evaluation/quality-latency.png)

Compared with relation-only Jev, the second stage adds **6.03 percentage points of average Recall@5** for about **0.85 seconds** more model-call time. It also improves average recall by **2.51 points over Vector Graph RAG + GPT-5-mini** and **3.52 points over HippoRAG 2**.

On the plotted Pareto frontier, no alternative offers both at least the same recall and no more additional model-call time, with a strict improvement in either. Two-stage Jev is the frontier's highest-quality option; direct retrieval and relation-only Jev offer lower-latency choices at lower recall.

The horizontal axis excludes embedding, retrieval and answer generation. Jev uses recorded mean request durations; generative-model points use estimated range midpoints. The dotted Pareto frontier is conditional on those estimates. Naive RAG adds no judgment call, hence zero additional time.
